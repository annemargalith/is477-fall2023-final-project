# UCI Iris Dataset

## Overview: 

This repository has the purpose of applyign the reproducibility concept when performing different analysis in the UCI Iris Dataset. Reproducibility is an important concept in which we use the same inputs and methods to try to get the same results. By applying it in this repository, we will be looking at the transparency of the study, the different license types and copyrights from the data and software, as well as how to properly cite the data and how to identify issues when trying to reproduce results. 

## Data Availability

**UCI Iris Dataset**
- The dataset was taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (DOI: 10.24432/C56C76)

- The UCI Machine Learning Repository containing the dataset is under the following citation: 
Fisher,R. A.. (1988). Iris. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C56C76.

- License: This dataset is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. It allows for the sharing and adaptation of the datasets for any purpose, provided that the appropriate credit is given.

- Therefore, under this license, we will be including the dataset in our repository, since, with the right credit given, it can be shared. The data is contained in the iris folder inside our data folder of this repository.

## Analysis

The Iris dataset allows us to identify different statistics about three species of Iris. This dataset includes the variables of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By analyzing the pair plot created, we are able to compare those measurements between species. The Iris Setosa can be idenfied by its shorter petal lengths and widths when compared to the Iris Versicolar and Iris Virginica. The two latter ones show similarities but can still be separated whem comparing those measures.

For all the Iris species, the summary statistics identified are as follows:

Sepal Length: Ranges from 4.3 to 7.9 cm, with an average of 5.84 cm.
Sepal Width: Ranges from 2.0 to 4.4 cm, with an average of 3.05 cm.
Petal Length: Ranges from 1.0 to 6.9 cm, with an average of 3.76 cm.
Petal Width: Ranges from 0.1 to 2.5 cm, with an average of 1.20 cm

The pair plot also allows to note that there is a positive correlation between petal length and petal width, as we see that as one measure increases, so does the other. On the other hand, sepal length and sepal width do not have a clear correlation pattern. The sepal width and sepal length also seem to overlap more between all three species, not being as good of a diferentiator factor as the petal measurements.
